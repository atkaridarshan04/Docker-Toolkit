Absolutely! Based on your repo structure and the new **Nginx Reverse Proxy** project you're adding, here's an updated version of your `README.md` that:

* Adds your new project cleanly
* Maintains consistency with the other project descriptions
* Uses the folder name we previously discussed (`nginx-reverse-proxy`)

# **Docker Toolkit**

Welcome to the **Docker Toolkit** repository! This collection of projects showcases different implementations of Docker, covering various use cases such as **logging, networking, orchestration, reverse proxying, and monitoring**.

Each project focuses on a **specific aspect** of Dockerâ€™s ecosystem. **Step-by-step implementation guides** are provided for each project.

## **Projects**

### 1. **[Docker Swarm](./docker-swarm/)**

A **demo and basic setup** of Docker Swarm for container orchestration, enabling scaling and service management across multiple nodes.

* Deploys a simple application with **frontend and backend services**
* Demonstrates how to initialize a **Swarm cluster** and deploy applications using **services and stacks**

---

### 2. **[ELK Stack](./elk-stack/)**

Deploys the **Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK) stack** using Docker Compose for centralized log management.

* Collects logs using **Filebeat** and Docker logging drivers
* **Elasticsearch** stores and indexes logs
* **Logstash** processes and transforms incoming log data
* **Kibana** provides a web-based UI for visualization and analysis

---

### 3. **[Monitoring](./monitoring/)**

Deploys a **monitoring stack** using **Prometheus and Grafana** to collect and visualize system metrics.

* **Prometheus** scrapes metrics from Docker services
* **Grafana** displays interactive dashboards for real-time insights
* Integrates **Nginx Prometheus Exporter** to track web server performance

---

### 4. **[Traefik Reverse Proxy](./traefik-reverse_proxy/)**

Implements **Traefik as a modern reverse proxy** and load balancer for Docker services.

* Uses **domain-based routing** to forward requests dynamically
* Supports **automatic service discovery** using Docker events
* Provides a **web-based dashboard** to manage routes and monitor traffic
* Demonstrates integration with **Nginx as a backend service**

---

### 5. **[Nginx Reverse Proxy](./nginx-reverse-proxy/)**

Demonstrates how to configure **Nginx as a reverse proxy and load balancer** for multiple containerized backend applications.

* Routes HTTP and HTTPS traffic to backend services via **Nginx**
* Uses **Docker Compose** to orchestrate all services, including Nginx
* Includes a **self-signed SSL certificate** for testing HTTPS
* Implements **round-robin load balancing** between multiple backend containers
