# **Docker Toolkit**  

Welcome to the **Docker Toolkit** repository! This collection of projects showcases different implementations of Docker, covering various use cases such as **logging, networking, orchestration, and monitoring**.  

Each project focuses on a **specific aspect** of Dockerâ€™s ecosystem. **Step-by-step implementation guides** are provided for each project.

## **Projects**  

1. **[Docker Swarm](./docker-swarm/)** - A **demo and basic setup** of Docker Swarm for container orchestration, enabling scaling and service management across multiple nodes.  
   - Deploys a simple application with **frontend and backend services**.  
   - Demonstrates how to initialize a **Swarm cluster** and deploy applications using **services and stacks**. 

2. **[ELK Stack](./elk-stack/)** - Deploys the **Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK) stack** using Docker Compose for centralized log management.  
   - The setup includes collecting logs using **Filebeat** and forwarding logs from the **Docker daemon**.  
   - **Elasticsearch** stores and indexes logs.  
   - **Logstash** processes and transforms incoming log data.  
   - **Kibana** provides a web-based UI for visualization and analysis.  

3. **[Monitoring](./monitoring/)** - Deploys a **monitoring stack** using **Prometheus and Grafana** to collect and visualize system metrics.  
   - Uses **Prometheus** to scrape metrics from services.  
   - **Grafana** provides interactive dashboards for real-time monitoring.  
   - Integrates **Nginx Prometheus Exporter** to track web server performance.  

4. **[Nginx Reverse Proxy](./nginx-reverse_proxy/)** - Implements an **Nginx-based reverse proxy** for managing multiple services behind a single entry point.  
   - Configures Nginx to forward requests to backend services.  
   - Contains **self-signed certificates** for a secure demo setup.  
   - Uses Docker Compose to simplify setup and management.  

5. **[Traefik Reverse Proxy](./traefik-reverse_proxy/)** - Implements **Traefik as a modern reverse proxy** and load balancer for Docker services.  
   - Uses **domain-based routing** to forward requests dynamically.  
   - Supports **automatic service discovery** using Docker events.  
   - Provides a **web-based dashboard** to manage routes and monitor traffic.  
   - Demonstrates integration with **Nginx as a backend service** using **Docker Compose**.
